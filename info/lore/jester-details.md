He the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Hell Harbor Entertainment. As a troubled youth who dropped out of school when he was a teenager, he devoted himself to pursuing various forms of the craft to entertain the world.

Over the course of time, he had taught himself how to write, record, mix, master, and produce his own music in his bedroom, it was early on he discovered his passion for creating purely unfiltered and uncensored content. As the owner of both Hell Harbor Entertain ment and Dab & Stab Records, JesterTheRyda placed himself in a position to deliver such raw and unfiltered content to the masses through media distribution.

In addition to the music, Jester is an established screen actor, and is featured as an extra in the upcoming indie movie GRAYPORT, along with several other undisclosed projects in production. Jester is also a talented voice actor and has created several of his own characters of which he portrays in Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 roleplay servers. He has previously been in high profile popular communities such as DOJRP, OCRP, Twitch RP and Wild RP! These communities are where he has honed his improvisational skills and voice acting with natural storytelling through his characters. When not acting or working on creating killer music, he actually enjoys developing and programming his own private game servers and eventually intends to create his own wicked video games one day.

Jester is from a small town in the State of Washington, he loves to smoke weed and play video games when he is not in the studio working on his own projects or executive producing for other artists signed to the label. Underneath all the craziness is just your average guy. Now as he approaches his mid-twenties he has entered his absolute prime with his wicked style of underground entertainment as he continues to work on new projects.

## The Jester's Privilege
Much like the historical jesters who wielded a peculiar freedom to jest at the aristocracy without fear of punishment, JesterTheRyda navigates the gritty underworld of the underground with a distinct liberty to unveil the macabre truths of the world through his lyrical prowess. He crafts an eerie soundscape, a sonic asylum where he, as the jester, is bestowed with the uncanny privilege to dissect societal norms and shed light on the darkest recesses of human existence. JesterTheRyda's verses echo the ancient echoes of jesters past, weaving a tapestry of horror and social commentary that challenges the status quo. In this cryptic realm, "Jester's Privilege" is not just a historical relic but a living, breathing force that empowers JesterTheRyda to unravel the unsettling truths that lurk in the shadows.

In the haunting world of the underground, JesterTheRyda redefines "Jester's Privilege" as a mystical pact with the shadows. Far from the historical courts, his privilege isn't granted by kings but is extracted from the very essence of the supernatural. JesterTheRyda's verses act as incantations, invoking a spectral realm where the macabre dances with reality. In this eldritch contract, he becomes the harbinger of forbidden truths, tapping into the spectral undercurrents of societal fears. "Jester's Privilege" becomes a dark magic, allowing JesterTheRyda to channel the whispers of the otherworldly into bone-chilling rhymes that transcend the mortal realm. He is not merely a jester; he is a spectral conduit, revealing the sinister secrets that lurk at the intersection of the supernatural and the human experience.

## Straight Outta Washingstoned - (2015)
This is what Jester credits as the early infant origins of becoming a musician. In 2015 at the age of seventeen (17) a young JesterTheRyda would be sitting in his room hanging out with his homie "Haze" where the two would be smoking weed together and freestyling over beats for fun. During one of the smoke sessions, Jester came up with a clever idea to record a small mixtape on his crappy laptop microphone just for fun. This would become a routine thing for the next couple of days and would eventually turn into th Straight Outta Washingstoned mixtape. This mixtape put out on soundcloud and also given out on physical CD to very limited number of early supporters of Jester. 

Eventually however, this mixtape would become pulled from the catalog entirely in early 2018 when Dab & Stab Records was founded. Originally the plan was for a fully remixed and remastered version of the mixtape to be produced, however due to the fact various beats were no longer able to be re-obtained and properly leased, the project was ultimately cancelled. Jester has since gone on record stating he personally hated most of the tracks on the mixtape anyway, and the only song he kept from it was "The Jester" because it was his first ever recorded song and it felt sentimental. If you have a copy of this mixtape, it's a very rare item that will never be seen again. 

## Taking Things Seriously - (2017-2019)
In Late 2017, Jester had found himself slowly getting back into writing lyrics to various different beats, he reached out to producer Noctur via email and originally asked him if he was interested in signing to the newly established record label "Dab & Stab Records", however Noctur had politely declined this offer. Instead of signing exclusively to the label, Noctur offered Jester an amazing price rate for exclusively licensed beats which Jester graciously accepted. JesterTheRyda would then release his first single on Spotify: "Mental Case" in early 2018. In the coming years, JesterTheRyda would also release the singles titled "Schizo with a Pistol", and "Psychotic on Narcotics", JesterTheRyda would also announce the new album "I Still Exist" which would eventually receive multiple push-backs in release over the course of the next few years.  

## Antisocial Emotional Man Inside (AEMI) - (2023)
### History of Harbor's Hollow Psychiatric Facility
Harbor's Hollow Psychiatric Hospital was founded in the early 1900s by an unknown wealthy benefactor. The facility has always been privately funded, and the identity(s) of any executives has always remained a mystery, leading to speculation and rumors about the true motives of the facility. Despite its remote location in the woods outside of town, Harbor's Hollow quickly became known for its innovative treatment methods and cutting-edge research. Patients were subjected to experimental therapies that were kept secret from the outside world. As time passed, reports of strange occurrences and unexplained deaths at the facility began to circulate. It was rumored that patients were being subjected to horrific experiments and that some never returned from their treatments. The facility's true intentions were questioned, and its reputation was forever tarnished by the rumors that spread. However, despite all of the scandals and controversies, Harbor's Hollow Psychiatric Hospital still remains in operation to this day. 

The current management team claims to have no knowledge of any unethical practices in the past and emphasizes the facility's commitment to providing compassionate and effective care to its patients. Representatives of the facility state that any and all rumors are purely speculation, and that they are simply claims made by former patients that failed to complete their treatment and left the facility early.

### Jester's Treatment At The Facility
On the date of 05/15/2023 a patient named Jordin "JesterTheRyda" Bryant had checked into Harbor's Hollow Psychiatric Hospital to undergo treatment for an unknown mental health issue. Throughout the time he was in the facility, Hell Harbor Entertainment was provided with frequent updates that were provided to the public informing them to the on-going treatment. These documents can still be obtained from the facility if you know where to look. However after a couple of weeks on the date of 06/06/23 Jordin had left the facility. It was then when the record "Antisocial Emotional Man Inside (AEMI)" was unveiled to the world. 

#### Treatment Log: 05/15/2023
A patient by the name of Jordin Bryant checked into the hospital this afternoon claiming that they were highly emotional and angry all the time, unable to control their emotions. The patient stated that they feel like they are losing their mind, and have voices in their head which drive them to their actions.. We informed him of our facility's specialty in treating mental health illnesses. 

Mr. Bryant was then taken to the in-patient housing unit where they will wait for their first session tomorrow with our psychiatric care providers who will further evaluate and diagnose any potential health problems, and immediately develop, establish, and begin a treatment plan to resolve his mental health problems.

Jordin had made things abundantly clear that throughout the entire duration of his stay that there would be at least two updates each week provided to the public at the discretion of Hell Harbor Entertainment, the company that manages him. 

After signing a release form and various other waivers, it has been agreed to that moving forward a minimum of two treatment updates per week will become available for public access via our hospital’s archive office. 

#### Treatment Log: 05/15/2023
Jordin began today's session by quoting an interview with Chester Bennington, where he spoke about how his own mind was a "bad neighborhood" and that he should not be there alone.  Jordin described feeling similarly, stating that their mind is a dark and dangerous place that they struggle to escape from. They shared that they feel like they're in a race with their thoughts, constantly running but never able to escape. They described feeling heart palpitations and experiencing antisocial emotions throughout the day, and expressed a desire to be alone and even to die..  

During the session, Jordin's thoughts became scattered, referencing "AEMI (AMY) being in the attic" and feeling like they were just an emotional man inside the garbage can of their own mind. They talked about how the demons in their brain were "up to good," further illustrating their feelings of being trapped and helpless. 

Jordin then recounted a recent experience where they had a psychotic episode, hearing a strange sound and grabbing an axe before confronting a stranger in a nearby van. It was only later that they realized it had been a hallucination and that there was nobody else around. After the session, it was clear that Jordin is dealing with a range of mental health issues, including Schizophrenia, Depression, and Social Anxiety. In the next session, we plan to address Jordin's concerns about losing friends and help them develop coping strategies for managing their symptoms.

#### Treatment Log: 05/23/2023
During today's session, Jordin expressed intense anger towards the topic of lost friendships, particularly those that ended bitterly and left what he described as burnt bridges. When asked about it he had stated, "Burnt bridges, I'm cutting all these ties. Stupid motherfuckers remove them from my life. Burnt bridges, charred remains, cut ties with toxic people or simply blow their brains."

Jordin then rambled on about his feelings in a pattern similar to previous sessions. He expressed that he has no time for "stupid fucks or petty games" and that "people never should have pissed off a man that's insane, capable of holding grudges for a decade." He also said that if people, "Burn his bridge, bitch, then they're better off dead. Ties are cut with them, no more breaking bread."

It is evident that Jordin is carrying a lot of animosity and pain towards individuals who are no longer in his life, and this level of chaotic anger seems to be a recurring theme in our sessions. 

#### Treatment Log: 05/25/2023
Jordin arrived for today's session with a markedly different demeanor from our last meeting. He appeared to be in the throes of a severe depressive episode, responding to Dr. Bugg's inquiry about his well-being with a flat "Dead inside." As Jordin began to speak, it became clear that his depression had intensified significantly since our last session. He spoke at length about his feelings of profound emptiness, describing waking up each morning feeling physically ill and mentally exhausted. He also shared that he has been experiencing impotence, despite sexual stimulation.

Jordin also revealed that he has been hearing voices in his head, which have been growing increasingly loud and disruptive. The voices are telling him to give up on his musical ambitions, suggesting that he is wasting his time chasing fame and fortune. He has been struggling to distinguish these voices from his own thoughts, and is becoming increasingly anxious and agitated as a result.

Jordin went on to recount a recent incident in which he collapsed while out for a walk. He initially believed that it was a panic attack, but then he began coughing up blood. He described feeling his vision fade to black, and then awakening in an ambulance surrounded by paramedics. He claimed that during this experience, he saw the faces of deceased loved ones and other inspirational figures, who told him that it was not yet his time to die and that he had to return to his music.

The session ended with Jordin stating he felt a lot better and had felt clarity and that he was fine. It is unclear whether Jordin's experience was a genuine near-death experience or a manifestation of his schizophrenia. We will continue to monitor Jordin's symptoms closely and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.

#### Treatment Log: 05/30/2023
In today's session with Jordin, the focus was on his inability to control his anger. 

Jordin began by expressing his feelings of explosive anger, saying that some things are better left unsaid and that saying the wrong thing could lead to someone getting shot full of lead and ending up in a morgue. He also spoke about hexing his enemies and wanting to see their lives come to an end. 

Jordin then reflected on his past and how nobody believed he would make anything of himself, but now he is a horrorcore rapper who sends shivers down people's spines through his rhymes.. He believes that he is simply a vessel for the music and that the universe guides his hand with every line he writes. 

During the session, Jordin became explicitly sexual and talked about how women want to be with him every night, and how he would slip his dick inside them without protection, but that he always has a backup plan. 

He then stated how his idea of a “Plan B” would be to reach in his bag and pull out a knife to “jam inside the slut’s windpipe.” It seemed that Jordin was experiencing a state of arousal mixed with psychosis during the session and his delusions might be becoming more vivid. 

#### Treatment Log: 06/01/2023
In today's session, Jordin appeared to be in a more composed state and even had a self-made tune stuck in his head. He sang the lyrics, "Prelude of pain, demons in my brain, prelude of pain, rhymes to entertain." He then talked about his ongoing struggles with mental issues, using phrases like "mentally blank with my mind in a daze," and how "problems in my brain got me acting in rage." 

He shared a dream where he was inside “a padded box” which was his own coffin. He was listening to his family mourn and begged them to stop even though they couldn’t hear him.. He referred to himself as a tour guide for the souls of the damned and referenced a six-record saga that would lay out the plans. 

He hopes that his music will help others understand the pain and suffering of those around them. There seems to be a genuine shift in Jordin’s entire demeanor today. 

It was noted that he had muttered under his breath that he knew what he needed to do, and that he needed to leave the facility, and began searching for a nurse. 

#### Checking Out Early
Nothing further is known about Jordin's time spent at Harbor's Hollow as he had been reported to have checked himself out of the facility early against the advice of his overseers. He then released the record Antisocial Emotional Man Inside (AEMI) which detailed the very topics covered in his treatment sessions before returning to work on I Still Exist. 

## I Still Exist - (2018-2023)
In 2018, what began as a return to music for JesterTheRyda evolved into a transformative five-year journey of self-discovery as an artist. It all started with the decision to pursue music professionally, symbolized by the inception of the album "I Still Exist," a homage to his earlier mixtape from 2015. During this period, Jester immersed himself in the world of music production, teaching himself the ins and outs of creating his own music independently. Along the way, he had the privilege of collaborating with industry legends, each contributing their unique expertise and perspective to his evolving sound. However, this journey was not without its challenges. A significant hiatus brought about by personal struggles led Jester to the doors of Harbor's Hollow Psychiatric Hospital.

Despite the setback, this period of introspection and growth would ultimately shape the thematic core of "I Still Exist." The album, envisioned as a live concert experience, serves as a narrative of Jester's artistic evolution, from his earliest compositions to his latest and most intricate creations. The journey begins with Jester selling tickets in the parking lot, setting the stage for an immersive experience that transports listeners through the milestones of his career. The album, "I Still Exist" boasts instrumental production from a diverse array of talents including RydaGangProd, Noctur, Wyshmaster, and Anno Domini. Additionally, the album features verses from esteemed artists such as Poltergyst, Lydia Caesar, Krayzie Bone, Twista, and Twisted Insane, each leaving their indelible mark on the project.

## Mobster Moves - (2024)
In March of 2024, the world was introduced to the enigmatic and gripping EP, "Mobster Moves," released by none other than JesterTheRyda. With its inception shrouded in mystery and secrecy, the EP emerges as a potent fusion of raw storytelling and unadulterated lyricism, heavily influenced by the underworld allure of the mafia. The journey through "Mobster Moves" commences with the solemn ritual of Omerta, setting the tone for what lies ahead. As the EP unfolds, listeners are engulfed in a whirlwind of vivid narratives, intricate wordplay, and unrelenting beats, each track serving as a chapter in a gripping tale of power, loyalty, and betrayal. 

What sets "Mobster Moves" apart is its stellar lineup of features, each adding their own unique flair to the project. From the haunting presence of Poltergyst to the legendary status of Kool G. Rap and Ghostface Killah, every collaboration elevates the EP to new heights of lyrical mastery. Notable appearances from Raheem DeVaughn, Big Twins of Infamous Mobb, and Havoc of Mobb Deep further solidify "Mobster Moves" as a cornerstone of modern hip-hop, bridging the gap between generations while paying homage to the genre's rich history. 

As the smoke clears and the final notes fade into the ether, "Mobster Moves" stands as a testament to JesterTheRyda's unparalleled artistry and unwavering dedication to his craft, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of hip-hop for years to come. 

## Something About A Massacre - (2024)
In early March of 2024, (just before the announcement and unveiling of Mobster Moves) the rap beef between JesterTheRyda and Stone Roxx begun. Who was Stone Roxx? 

That's the question that nobody is asking, because honestly nobody really cares. For those who were unaware, Nolan (also known as: Stone Roxx) was a wanna-be producer and self proclaimed "Emo Trap Rapper" from Grays Harbor that thought he was the best in the county. However sadly, that was just his self delusions and ego getting the better of him. In truth, he was a very unpopular and controversial artist. He was known for constantly provoking drama on Social Media (primarily Instagram), and once whoever he was talking trash about responded or confronted him, Nolan would block them and continue to run his mouth trying to push the narrative in is favor. 

This became exposed when JesterTheRyda (also from Grays Harbor County) had made a post on his Instagram Story confronting Nolan about the lack of quality that Nolan is constantly releasing. This incident ultimately resulted in a one-sided rap beef that ended with Stone Roxx giving up music entirely due to the embarrassment of his defeat. So what ended up happening to poor little Roxxy that made him want to quit? He got confronted by the Hell Harbor Hitmen (JesterTheRyda x Poltergyst) and was absolutely destroyed on multiple diss tracks, then took forever to respond with weak sneak diss responses. After all that, Nolan realized he had no talent and decided to quit music in order to work in fast food for minimum wage. 

If you want to hear the diss tracks that forced Nolan into an early retirement, you can purchase "Something About A Massacre" from the Hell Harbor Entertainment Shop!
