## Antisocial Emotional Man Inside (AEMI)
### History of Harbor's Hollow Psychiatric Facility
Harbor's Hollow Psychiatric Hospital was founded in the early 1900s by an unknown wealthy
benefactor. The facility has always been privately funded, and the identity(s) of any executives has always remained a mystery, leading to speculation and rumors about the true motives of the facility. Despite its remote location in the woods outside of town, Harbor's Hollow quickly became known for its innovative treatment methods and cutting-edge research. Patients were subjected to experimental therapies that were kept secret from the outside world. As time passed, reports of strange occurrences and unexplained deaths at the facility began to circulate. It was rumored that patients were being subjected to horrific experiments and that some never returned from their treatments. The facility's true intentions were questioned, and its reputation was forever tarnished by the rumors that spread. However, despite all of the scandals and controversies, Harbor's Hollow Psychiatric Hospital still remains in operation to this day. The current management team claims to have no knowledge of any unethical practices in the past and emphasizes the facility's commitment to providing compassionate and effective care to its patients. Representatives of the facility state that any and all rumors are purely speculation, and that they are simply claims made by former patients that failed to complete their treatment and left the facility early.

It was then when the record "Antisocial Emotional Man Inside (AEMI)" was unveiled to the world.
